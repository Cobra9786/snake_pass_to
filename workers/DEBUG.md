Use the Workers Logs in Cloudflare Dashboard
Log in to your Cloudflare account.

Navigate to the Workers tab in your Cloudflare dashboard.

Select your Worker (e.g., d1-worker-production).

Look for the Logs section:

If available, it will show invocation logs, console logs, and error details.

This can help you identify issues that may not appear in the Wrangler tail command.

Enable Debugging Mode in Worker Code
If you need more detailed logs:

Update your Worker to include additional console.log statements:

javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log('Request headers:', request.headers);
console.log('Request body:', await request.json());
console.log('Environment:', env);
Deploy the updated Worker using:

bash
Copy
Edit
wrangler deploy --env production
Use either wrangler tail or the Cloudflare dashboard to check logs.

4. Debug with the Cloudflare Worker Editor
The Cloudflare dashboard has a built-in editor for debugging:

Open the Worker in the dashboard.

Click the Quick Edit button.

Modify your code directly to add debug outputs or test changes.

Test the Worker using the Send Test Request feature:

Input the request URL, headers, and body as required.

Check the live output in the editor for logs and responses.


# 6. Verify Your Worker
Ensure the Cloudflare Worker and API endpoint are operational:

Run the same request using curl or Postman to verify the API works correctly:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -v -X POST 'https://d1-worker-production.rustchain64.workers.dev/api/login' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "produser1", "password": "prodpass1"}'
